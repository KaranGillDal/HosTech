    <p class="w3-large">Diafriendie is a place where people share their experience about diabetes and the ways to manage it. To keep our community safe, we enforce our Golden Rule: Don't be Mean, Don't be Gross, and Don't Use Diafriendie to Break the Law.<br><br>
      <p class="w3-large">

        <b>Don’t Be Mean.</b>  Bullying is not allowed on Diafriendie. Don’t defame, impersonate, or abuse another person. Don’t share personal information about another person, including addresses or phone numbers. Hate speech targeted towards any group of people will be removed from our services. This includes hateful speech on the basis of gender, sexuality, race, religion and ethnicity. 
<br><b>Don’t Be Gross.</b> You can use your own pictures on Diafriendie but we don’t allow posts that are gross, gory or pornographic.
<br><b>Don’t Use Diafriendie to Break the Law.</b> Please don’t post pictures you don’t have the rights to. If you are not sure, don’t post it. Don’t post nude or intimate pictures. Do not use Diafriendie to engage in or promote illegal behavior such as selling controlled substances or solicitation. If you solicit minors for any reason or post sexually explicit pictures of minors, we will suspend your account and report you to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Do not make threats of violence, we may share your information with law enforcement if we think you have made a threat to the safety of others. We can be required by law to disclose your information if we receive a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
<br><br>

We actively moderate the service and ban users who violate these rules. We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content for violating these guidelines or for any reason, but particularly to protect our users and community.
<br>
We treat references to self-harm and eating disorders seriously. Any posts glorifying these issues will be deleted.
Thanks for using Diafriendie and being a part of our Community.
